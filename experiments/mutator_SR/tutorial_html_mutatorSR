<!-- <p><b><font color=red>YOU WILL NOT BE PAID FOR ANY ADDITIONAL HITS YOU COMPLETE.</b> </font> Please, do not attempt more than one HIT in this group. </p> -->
<p><Please close all other programs/tabs while running this task to get the optimal system performance.  Users on a suboptimal system can experience glitches that will lead to rejection.  Also, low scores on this task will lead to rejection: make sure to read these instructions!</p>
<p>Thank you for your interest! You are contributing to ongoing vision research at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology McGovern Institute for Brain Research.</p>
<p><b>This task will require you to look at images on your computer screen and use your arrow keys to indicate a response for about 15 minutes, although we expect this to take about 5-10 minutes. If you cannot meet these requirements for any reason, or if doing so could cause discomfort or injury to you, do not accept this HIT.</b></p>
<p><b>We encourage you to try a little bit of this HIT before accepting to ensure it is compatible with your system. If you think the task is working improperly, your computer may be incompatible.</b></p>
<p>We recommend this task for those who are interested in contributing to scientific endeavors. Your answers will help MIT researchers better understand how the brain processes visual information.</p>

<ul>
<li>You will see a series of images, each one presented for a very brief time. Each image will contain one out of four possible 3D objects. The objects were designed to be novel to humans, so they might look strange to you.
<p>
<li>After you see an image, <b>you must use your arrow keys (&#8592;, &#8593;, &#8594;, &#8595;) to select one of four options.</b> <!--Through <b>trial-and-error</b>, you will learn which object is matched with what option. -->
<p>
<li>Once you select an option, you will be told whether your choice was correct or incorrect. You will then move on to the next image immediately, so be ready.
<p>
<li>It will take time to learn to do this well. You will receive a <b>bonus for correct answers</b>, so try your best! However, <font color=red><b>low performance will lead to rejection</b>.</font> </li>
<p>
<li> When you have worked though all the images, this HIT <b>will submit itself automatically</b>. </li>

<p>
<li>Please be sure to maximize your browser window before beginning this experiment.</li>
<p>
<li>In total, you will see 200 images. We expect this experiment to take about 10 minutes. Note that the HIT will expire if you spend more than 25 minutes, so plan your time accordingly.</li>
<p>
 <li>You will have <b>10 learning trials with everyday objects</b> at the beginning to help you get a feel for the task.</li> 
<p>
<li>When you are ready to begin, click the "Begin" button. <b>Be prepared to see the first image -- it happens very fast!</b></li>
<p>
<li>If you have questions or concerns about this HIT, feel free to contact the requester. You can re-read these instructions at any time by clicking the link in the upper right-hand corner of the screen. Good luck!</li>
