<li>Thank you for your interest! You are contributing to ongoing visual neuroscience research at the MIT McGovern Institute for Brain Research.</p></li>
<p><li>The HIT will require you to look at images and use your arrow keys to select a response based on what you saw. 
<p><li>We expect this to take about 10 minutes, though you will have 25 minutes total.</p></li> 
<p><li>If you cannot meet these requirements for any reason, or if doing so could cause discomfort or injury to you, do not accept this HIT.</p></li>

<li><p>Your responses will help MIT researchers better understand how the brain processes visual information.</p></li>

<li>You will see a series of images, each one presented for a very brief time. Each image will contain one out of two possible 3D objects.
<p>
<li>After you see an image, you must use your arrow keys (&#8592;, &#8594;) to select one of two options.  
<p>
<li>Once you select an option, you will be told whether your choice was correct or incorrect. You will then move on to the next image immediately, so be ready.
<p>
<li>Please try your best! <font color=red><b>Low performance (random guessing) will lead to rejection on this HIT</b>.</font> </li>
