<p><font color=red><b>This task will require you to look at images on your computer screen and use your arrow keys to indicate a response for about 15 minutes, although we expect this to take about 5-10 minutes. If you cannot meet these requirements for any reason, or if doing so could cause discomfort or injury to you, do not accept this HIT.</b></font></p>
<p><font color=red><b>We encourage you to try a little bit of this HIT before accepting to ensure it is compatible with your system. If you think the task is working improperly, your computer may be incompatible.</b></font></p>
<p>We recommend this task for those who are interested in contributing to scientific endeavors. Your answers will help MIT researchers better understand how the brain processes visual information.</p>

<ul>
<li>You will see a series of images, each one presented for a very brief time. Each image will contain one out of four possible 3D objects.
<p>
<li>After you see an image, <b>you must use your arrow keys (&#8592;, &#8593;, &#8594;, &#8595;) to select one of four options.</b> Through <b>trial-and-error</b>, you will learn which object is matched with what option. 
<p>
<li>Once you select an option, you will be told whether your choice was correct or incorrect. You will then move on to the next image immediately, so be ready.
<p>
<li>It will take some time to learn to do this well. <b>You will receive a bonus for correct answers<b>, so try your best! </li>
<p>
<li><font color=red> When you have worked though all the images, this HIT <b>will submit itself automatically</b>. </font></li>
