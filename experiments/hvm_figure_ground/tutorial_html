<p><font color=red><b>This task will require you to look at images on your computer screen and click to indicate a response for up to about 15 minutes, although we expect this to take about 5-10 minutes. If you cannot meet these requirements for any reason, or if doing so could cause discomfort or injury to you, do not accept this HIT.</b></font></p>
<p><font color=red><b>We encourage you to try a little bit of this  HIT before accepting to ensure it is compatible with your system. If you think the task is working improperly, your computer may be incompatible.</b></font></p>
<p>We recommend this task for those who are interested in contributing to scientific endeavors. Your answers will help MIT researchers better understand how the brain processes visual information.</p>

<ul>
<li>You will see a series of images, each one presented for a very brief time. Each image will feature a single object from 64 possibilities. The objects are common things you might see around your house, on TV, in books, or on the Internet. There will also be a red dot either on the object or on the background.
<p>
<li>After you see the image, choose the image that corresponds to whether the dot was on the object or on the background.
<p>
<li>For example, if you think you saw a dot on the object, click the picture that also has a dot on the object
<p>
<li>Even if you're not 100% sure of what you saw, <u><b>make your best guess.</b></u></li>
<p>
<li>When you have worked though all the images, this HIT <b>will submit itself automatically</b>.</li>
